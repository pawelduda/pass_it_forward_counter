### Pass It Forward Counter

Create a class that counts up to a given number (e.g. from 0 to 1000 or from -300 to 10, integers only), in a specific way:
When its' first instance does the counting, it increments the number by 1, then passes it forward to the next object, which
in turn does the same thing, until the desired number has been reached. Then it should be returned by the program.

Things that will be considered when evaluating the code:
- readability
- simplicity
- test coverage
